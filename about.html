         <h4><strong><em>Why programming</em></strong></h4>
         <p>Programming has always been a field of interest since highschool.This was one of the main reasons why i joined <span class="school"> jkuat </span> to study<em> Telecommunication and information engineering</em>.It however become clear very quickly that the course was not  purely about  coding.I then decided to join Moringa School to learn about progarmming which had my field of interest all along.
